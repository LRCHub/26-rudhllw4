It's a thankless task, but I'm up for it
I'm taking you into deep water
Nobody cares if you sink or swim
So when you're over your head
Just remember how you got there

Lets put our cards on the table
'Cause I'm ready
Willing and able
A man, I am your man for the season
I just need help to breathe

And now
Now that the smoke has cleared
Your eyes may be open
But I know you can't see
All your tall tales have fall on deaf ears
You preach to the choir
But it's same old story

So lets put our cards on the table
(Cause I'm ready)
Yeah I'm ready, baby
Willing and able
Oh, I am the man for the season
Oh, just give one good reason
Oh

Oh yea, yeah
Woo

You know many times, baby
How many ways
Suffered your lies, and I won't forget it
Cause its gone on too long
You've lost your way
Pushed it too far
And you're gonna regret it
Yes

(Let's put our cards on the table)
Yeah 'cause Im ready, ready
(Ready and able)
I am the man, you're man for the season
I just need one good reason
One good reason
One good reason
Oh
Woo
Yes
